# [autoTracc](https://autotracc.streamlit.app) 

**autoTracc** is a student dashboard app built using the Python framework [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/), for the students of PSG College of Technology,
to instantly view the following :

+ **Affordable leaves that can be taken to maintain their attendance percentages**

+ **GPA and CGPA in every semester**

+ **Tabulated exam schedule** (in [studzone](https://ecampus.psgtech.ac.in/studzone) it looks as if each exam got an ID card)

<p></p>

# Privacy
The app is designed such that, a user's credentials are used to directly access the frontend of their user profile from the college's official studzone sites to fetch the data. The fetched data is only stored and processed in said user's session to view the above mentioned features.

Neither the user's credentials nor their fetched data is stored or acquired by me.
